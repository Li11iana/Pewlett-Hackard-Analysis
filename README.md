# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
For this challenge the company Pewlett-Hackard is facing a growing number of employees approaching retirement age. If measures are not taken in advance it could leave the company unprepared to face the challenges ahead. This project aims to utilize the data from the company database using SQL and provide the information needed to prepare for the upcoming transition in staff.

Through SQL a employee information database was generated, the data was analyzed and condensed to provides management about the retiring employeees as well as identifying mentorship candidates from the remaining personnel. The report aims to lead the company's strategic planning in the face of significant structural change.

### Objective
Using PostgreSQL & pgAdmin generate a unified database for all company employee information and obtain from said database information about the number of retiring employees as well as the number of employees eligible for mentorship.

## Results
Company employee information in Excel files was analyzed to establish how the data related between files using Quick Database Diagrams (QuickDBD) as shown in the next Image:

Based on that diagram the database on PostgreSQL was generated. From there the following queries and report tables were created to address  retiring personnel concerns.
